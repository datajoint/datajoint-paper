\subsection*{Sharing data and distributed computation}
Through the features described above, DataJoint naturally supports collaboration and distributed access by
\begin{itemize}
\item setting, enforcing, and communicating dependencies between data elements,
\item keeping data definition and computation code together in the same class for easy review and sharing,
\item storing and organizing data in a popular database management system (MySQL) that can be accessed through a variety of third-party interfaces,
\item allowing safe simultaneous access to the same data through standard transaction processing provided by MySQL, and
\item providing an automatic and transparent job reservation process for conflict-free distributed processing.
\end{itemize}
