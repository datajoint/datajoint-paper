The rise of big data in modern research poses serious challenges for data management: Large and intricate datasets from diverse instrumentation must be precisely aligned, annotated, and processed in a variety of ways to extract new insights. 
While high levels of data integrity are expected, research teams have diverse backgrounds, are geographically dispersed, and rarely possess a primary interest in data science. 
Here we describe DataJoint, an open-source toolbox designed for manipulating and processing scientific data under the relational data model. 
Designed for scientists who need a flexible and expressive database language with few basic concepts and operations, DataJoint facilitates multi-user access, efficient queries, and distributed computing. 
With implementations in both MATLAB and Python, DataJoint is not limited to particular file formats, acquisition systems, or data modalities and can be quickly adapted to new experimental designs.
