	abstract = {Summary
Neural responses are modulated by brain state, which varies with arousal, attention, and behavior. In mice, running and whisking desynchronize the cortex and enhance sensory responses, but the quiescent periods between bouts of exploratory behaviors have not been well studied. We found that these periods of “quiet wakefulness” were characterized by state fluctuations on a timescale of 1–2 s. Small fluctuations in pupil diameter tracked these state transitions in multiple cortical areas. During dilation, the intracellular membrane potential was desynchronized, sensory responses were enhanced, and population activity was less correlated. In contrast, constriction was characterized by increased low-frequency oscillations and higher ensemble correlations. Specific subtypes of cortical interneurons were differentially activated during dilation and constriction, consistent with their participation in the observed state changes. Pupillometry has been used to index attention and mental effort in humans, but the intracellular dynamics and differences in population activity underlying this phenomenon were previously unknown.},

	abstract = {Neural codes are believed to have adapted to the statistical properties of the natural environment. However, the principles that govern the organization of ensemble activity in the visual cortex during natural visual input are unknown. We recorded populations of up to 500 neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex and characterized the structure of their activity, comparing responses to natural movies with those to control stimuli. We found that higher order correlations in natural scenes induced a sparser code, in which information is encoded by reliable activation of a smaller set of neurons and can be read out more easily. This computationally advantageous encoding for natural scenes was state-dependent and apparent only in anesthetized and active awake animals, but not during quiet wakefulness. Our results argue for a functional benefit of sparsification that could be a general principle governing the structure of the population activity throughout cortical microcircuits.

Modern non-relational databases offer an alternative that has flexibility, scalability, and a non-rigid design schema. Moreover, with an accelerated development pace, non-relational databases like CouchDB can be ideal tools to construct bioinformatics utilities. We describe CouchDB by presenting three new bioinformatics resources: (a) geneSmash, which collates data from bioinformatics resources and provides automated gene-centric annotations, (b) drugBase, a database of drug–target interactions with a web interface powered by geneSmash, and (c) HapMap-CN, which provides a web interface to query copy number variations from three SNP-chip HapMap datasets.

	abstract = {Objective
As biomedical technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, researchers can probe ever more subtle effects with the added requirement that the investigation of small effects often requires the acquisition of large amounts of data. In biomedicine, these data are often acquired at, and later shared between, multiple sites. There are both technological and sociological hurdles to be overcome for data to be passed between researchers and later made accessible to the larger scientific community. The goal of the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN) is to address the challenges inherent in biomedical data sharing.

Materials and methods
BIRN tools are grouped into ‘capabilities’ and are available in the areas of data management, data security, information integration, and knowledge engineering. BIRN has a user-driven focus and employs a layered architectural approach that promotes reuse of infrastructure. BIRN tools are designed to be modular and therefore can work with pre-existing tools. BIRN users can choose the capabilities most useful for their application, while not having to ensure that their project conforms to a monolithic architecture.

Results
BIRN has implemented a new software-based data-sharing infrastructure that has been put to use in many different domains within biomedicine. BIRN is actively involved in outreach to the broader biomedical community to form working partnerships.

Conclusion
BIRN's mission is to provide capabilities and services related to data sharing to the biomedical research community. It does this by forming partnerships and solving specific, user-driven problems whose solutions are then available for use by other groups.},

In particular, the latter makes data integration a difficult technical challenge. In this paper, we describe our work on semantic mediation and scientific workflows and discuss how these technologies address integration challenges in scientific data management. We first give an overview of the main data integration problems that arise from heterogeneity in the syntax, structure, and semantics of data. Starting from a traditional mediator approach, we show how semantic extensions can facilitate data integration in complex, multiple-world scenarios, where data sources cover different but related scientific domains. Such scenarios are not amenable to conventional schema integration approaches. The core idea of semantic mediation is to augment database mediators and query evaluation algorithms with appropriate knowledge representation techniques to exploit information from shared ontologies. Semantic mediation relies on semantic data registration, which associates existing data with semantic information from an ontology.
The Kepler scientific workflow system addresses the problem of synthesizing, from existing tools and applications, reusable workflow components and analytical pipelines to automate scientific analyses. After presenting core features and example workflows in Kepler, we present a framework for adding semantic information to scientific workflows. The resulting system is aware of semantically plausible connections between workflow components as well as between data sources and workflow components. This information can be used by the scientist during workflow design, and by the workflow engineer, for creating data transformation steps between semantically compatible but structurally incompatible analytical steps.},

	abstract = {Objectives
A. Identify the current state of data management needs of academic biomedical researchers. B. Explore their anticipated data management and analysis needs. C. Identify barriers to addressing those needs.
Design
A multimodal needs analysis was conducted using a combination of an online survey and in-depth one-on-one semi-structured interviews. Subjects were recruited via an e-mail list representing a wide range of academic biomedical researchers in the Pacific Northwest.
Measurements
The results from 286 survey respondents were used to provide triangulation of the qualitative analysis of data gathered from 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews.
Results
Three major themes were identified: 1) there continues to be widespread use of basic general-purpose applications for core data management; 2) there is broad perceived need for additional support in managing and analyzing large datasets; and 3) the barriers to acquiring currently available tools are most commonly related to financial burdens on small labs and unmet expectations of institutional support.
Conclusion
Themes identified in this study suggest that at least some common data management needs will best be served by improving access to basic level tools such that researchers can solve their own problems. Additionally, institutions and informaticians should focus on three components: 1) facilitate and encourage the use of modern data exchange models and standards, enabling researchers to leverage a common layer of interoperability and analysis; 2) improve the ability of researchers to maintain provenance of data and models as they evolve over time though tools and the leveraging of standards; and 3) develop and support information management service cores that could assist in these previous components while providing researchers with unique data analysis and information design support within a spectrum of informatics capabilities.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has led to an enormous growth in the study of cognitive neuroanatomy, and combined with advances in high-field electrophysiology (and other methods), has led to a fast-growing field of human neuroscience. Technological advances in both hardware and software will lead to an ever more promising future for fMRI. We have developed a new computational framework that facilitates fMRI experimentation and analysis, and which has led to some rethinking of the nature of experimental design and analysis. The Computational Neuroscience Applications Research Infrastructure (CNARI) incorporates novel methods for maintaining, serving, and analyzing massive amounts of fMRI data. By using CNARI, it is possible to perform naturalistic, network-based, statistically valid experiments in systems neuroscience on a very large scale, with ease of data manipulation and analysis, within reasonable computational time scales. In this article, we describe this infrastructure and then illustrate its use on a number of actual examples in both cognitive neuroscience and neurological research. We believe that these advanced computational approaches will fundamentally change the future shape of cognitive brain imaging with fMRI.},

	abstract = {Serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) is rapidly expanding as a primary tool to investigate synaptic circuitry and plasticity. The ultrastructural images collected through ssEM are content rich and their comprehensive analysis is beyond the capacity of an individual laboratory. Hence, sharing ultrastructural data is becoming crucial to visualize, analyze, and discover the structural basis of synaptic circuitry and function in the brain. We devised a web-based management system called SynapticDB (http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/synapticdb/) that catalogues, extracts, analyzes, and shares experimental data from ssEM. The management strategy involves a library with check-in, checkout and experimental tracking mechanisms. We developed a series of spreadsheet templates (MS Excel, Open Office spreadsheet, etc) that guide users in methods of data collection, structural identification, and quantitative analysis through ssEM. SynapticDB provides flexible access to complete templates, or to individual columns with instructional headers that can be selected to create user-defined templates. New templates can also be generated and uploaded. Research progress is tracked via experimental note management and dynamic PDF forms that allow new investigators to follow standard protocols and experienced researchers to expand the range of data collected and shared. The combined use of templates and tracking notes ensures that the supporting experimental information is populated into the database and associated with the appropriate ssEM images and analyses. We anticipate that SynapticDB will serve future meta-analyses towards new discoveries about the composition and circuitry of neurons and glia, and new understanding about structural plasticity during development, behavior, learning, memory, and neuropathology.},

We describe CouchDB by presenting three new bioinformatics resources: (a) geneSmash, which collates data from bioinformatics resources and provides automated gene-centric annotations, (b) drugBase, a database of drug–target interactions with a web interface powered by geneSmash, and (c) HapMap-CN, which provides a web interface to query copy number variations from three SNP-chip HapMap datasets.

Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.
Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

Such large datasets can be automatically analyzed by taking advantage of the well-established relational database paradigm. Raw electrophysiology data can be entered into a database by extracting its interesting characteristics (e.g., firing rate). Compared to storing the raw data directly, this database representation is several orders of magnitude higher efficient in storage space and processing time. Using two large electrophysiology recording and simulation datasets, we demonstrate that the database can be queried, transformed and analyzed. This process is relatively simple and easy to learn because it takes place entirely in Matlab, using our database analysis toolbox, PANDORA. It is capable of acquiring data from common recording and simulation platforms and exchanging data with external database engines and other analysis toolboxes, which make analysis simpler and highly interoperable. PANDORA is available to be freely used and modified because it is open-source (http://software.incf.org/software/pandora/home).},

	abstract = {Over the past several years, the explosive growth of biological data generated by new high-throughput instruments has virtually begun to drown the biological community. There is no established infrastructure to deal with these data in a consistent and successful fashion. This thesis presents a new informatics platform capable of supporting a large subsection of the experimental methods found in modem biology. A consistent data definition strategy is outlined that can handle gel electrophoresis, microarray, fluorescence activated cell sorting, mass spectrometry, and microscopy within a single coherent set of information object definitions. A key issue for interoperability is that common attributes are made truly identical between the different methods. This dramatically decreases the overhead of separate and distinct classes for each method, and reserves the uniqueness for attributes that are different between the methods. Thus, at least one higher level of integration is obtained. The thesis shows that rich object-oriented modeling together with object-relational database features and the uniform treatment of data and metadata is an ideal candidate for complex experimental information integration tasks. This claim is substantiated by elaborating on the coherent set of information object definitions and testing the corresponded database using real experimental data. A first implementation of this work--ExperiBase--is an integrated software platform to store and query data generated by the leading experimental protocols used in biology within a single database. It provides: comprehensive database features for searching and classifying; web-based client interfaces; web services; data import and export capabilities to accommodate other data},

In this paper, we focus on a neuroscience application, Neuroanatomical Rat Brain Viewer (NeuART Viewer) to demonstrate alternative database concepts that allow neuroscientists to manage and exchange data. Requirements for the NeuART application, in combination with an underlying network-aware database, are described at a conceptual level. Emphasis is placed on functionality from the user's perspective and on requirements that the database must fulfill. The most important functionality required by neuroscientists is the ability to construct brain models using information from different repositories. To accomplish such a task, users need to browse remote and local sources and summaries of data and capture relevant information to be used in building and extending the brain models. Other functionalities are also required, including posing queries related to brain models, augmenting and customizing brain models, and sharing brain models in a collaborative environment. An extensible object-oriented data model is presented to capture the many data types expected in this application. After presenting conceptual level design issues, we describe several known database solutions that support these requirements and discuss requirements that demand further research. Data integration for heterogeneous databases is discussed in terms of reducing or eliminating semantic heterogeneity when translations are made from one system to another. Performance enhancement mechanisms such as materialized views and spatial indexing for three-dimensional objects are explained and evaluated in the context of browsing, incorporating, and sharing. Policies for providing the system with fault tolerance and avoiding possible intellectual property abuses are presented. Finally, two existing systems are evaluated and compared using the identified requirements.},

	abstract = {Scientific visualization applications are very data-intensive, with high demands for I/O and data management. Developers of many visualization tools hesitate to use traditional DBMSs, due to the lack of support for these DBMSs on parallel platforms and the risk of reducing the portability of their tools and the user data. We propose the GODIVA framework, which provides simple database-like interfaces to help visualization tool developers manage their in-memory data, and I/O optimizations such as prefetching and caching to improve input performance at run time. We implemented the GODIVA interfaces in a stand-alone, portable user library, which can be used by all types of visualization codes: interactive and batch-mode, sequential and parallel. Performance results from running a visualization tool using the GODIVA library on multiple platforms show that the GODIVA framework is easy to use, alleviates developers' data management burden, and can bring substantial I/O performance improvement.},

	abstract = {Many areas of biological research generate large volumes of very diverse data. Managing this data can be a difficult and time-consuming process, particularly in an academic environment where there are very limited resources for IT support staff such as database administrators. The most economical and efficient solutions are those that enable scientists with minimal IT expertise to control and operate their own desktop systems. Axiope provides one such solution, Catalyzer, which acts as flexible cataloging system for creating structured records describing digital resources. The user is able specify both the content and structure of the information included in the catalog. Information and resources can be shared by a variety of means, including automatically generated sets of web pages. Federation and integration of this information, where needed, is handled by Axiope’s Mercat server. Where there is a need for standardization or compatibility of the structures used by different researchers this can be achieved later by applying user-defined mappings in Mercat. In this way, large-scale data sharing can be achieved without imposing unnecessary constraints or interfering with the way in which individual scientists choose to record and catalog their work. We summarize the key technical issues involved in scientific data management and data sharing, describe the main features and functionality of Axiope Catalyzer and Axiope Mercat, and discuss future directions and requirements for an information infrastructure to support large-scale data sharing and scientific collaboration.},
